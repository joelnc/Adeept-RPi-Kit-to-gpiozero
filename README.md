### gpiozero Fork of Adeept Ultimate Starter Kit Python Code for Raspberry Pi (RPi.GPIO) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Original Adeept Repo:
https://github.com/adeept/Adeept_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_Python_Code_for_RPi

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Motivation:
For young learners, the lower level RPi.GPIO library can be a bit overwhelming.  
Transitioning the projects to use the higher level gpiozero library 
(https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) makes them much more kid friendly 
when trying to teach circuitry, Python, emacs, git and ssh concurrently. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Structure:
Orignal RPi.GPIO scripts are in the Orig_Files folder, and available at the 
Adeept repo linked above.  Numbered python files in the main directory are
gpiozero scripts that are based on the projects in Adeept's repo, gpiozero
documentation recipes, or a combination of the two.  The scripts refer to either
wiring diagrams/fritzing avaialabe from Adeept via a post in the their issues
section, or to diagrams in the gpiozero recipes.
