### gpiozero Fork of Adeept Ultimate Starter Kit Python Code for Raspberry Pi (RPi.GPIO) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Original Adeept Repo:
https://github.com/adeept/Adeept_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_Python_Code_for_RPi

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Motivation:
For young learners, the lower level RPi.GPIO library can be a bit overwhelming.  
Transistioning the projects to use the higher level gpiozero library 
(https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) makes them much more kid friendly 
when trying to teach circuitry, Python, emacs, git and ssh concurrently. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Structure:
Orignal RPi.GPIO scripts are in the Original_Files folder, and available at the 
Adeept repo linked above.  Numbered python files in the main directory are gpiozero
scripts that are based on the projects in Adeept's repo.  The scripts refer to wiring 
diagrams/fritzing avaialbe from Adeept via a post in the their issues section.
