''' The first assignment of course was to build the circuit and run
the first two blinking LED scripts.  This may have raised some questions.  
If not, don't worry, I have some for you.
 
First up: In 01_blinkingLed_0.py, we had the command myLed.blink(2) or similar
with some other number in place of 2.  What exactly does the 2 do? Does it control
how long the LED is on? Or off? Or both?  Experiment to find out.

(2):  When building LED circuits on the breadboard without Python, the only way we
could make an LED blink was by wiring in a button and pressing it on/off to close the 
circuit.  Describe what you think myLed.blink(2) is "doing" to make the light go on 
and off.

(3) Examine the wiring setup on your breadboard.  Recall when building circuits
we would connect power (3V) to the power rail, run that through the resistor and LED,
and then return the current to the negative power rail and connect that to ground.  
What is different in this case? Where is the ground?
